          Log your sets, weight, reps, and RPE for your exercises in order to push
          yourself each time you visit the gym. Watch your lifts increase

        <h2>
          The RPE scale is used to measure the intensity of your exercise. The
          RPE scale runs from 0 â€“ 10. The numbers below relate to phrases used
          to rate how easy or difficult you find an activity. For example, 0
          (nothing at all) would be how you feel when sitting in a chair; 10
          (very, very heavy) is how you feel at the end of an exercise stress
          test or after a very difficult activity.
