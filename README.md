# Workout Journal/Log

Live Site: https://myworkoutlog-frontend.onrender.com/

## Introduction

- Here is a powerlifting workout log/journal website, where you can keep track of your information. 
- This fullstack project was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript using the React Library. 
- I have also included my sample 6-week tapering program to get ready for a powerlifting competition. 
- This 6-week program is designed to help you achieve peak strength for competitions. 
- If this sounds interesting to you, then check out my project!

## Getting Started

- [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/C6HonRzK/ATTI2dba90d40b2b4cf3fd344bbd15d3f31608073DF5/fs-workout-log) for the project's planning
- [Wireframe](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/a2a2b62a-d19a-495e-ad43-28136ad5dc91/edit?invitationId=inv_398f6ad8-7c33-4790-a97a-554c4a3f3959&page=0_0#), sketches of each screen's UI for the major funcionality of the application

- [Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/9687927b-ddae-4c27-9754-b9c16f4a3305/edit?page=0_0&invitationId=inv_efc94f68-efd1-4c90-b622-78f4e17d0ffa#). A diagram of the app's models (one per data entity) and the relationships between them.

## Unsolved Issues

- An unsolved issue is trying to adjust the navbar to stretch across the entire screen for the mobile view. 
- When viewing the workout posts, the table is too large for the screen, so you would have to scroll to the right side to view the rest of the table.

## Future Enhancements

- For future enhancements, I would like to optimize the web app for mobile. 
- For some reason, the app does not turn horizontally when I turn my phone to the side. I would also like to add a graph that tracks specific exercises/lifts so that I could see my strength progression.
